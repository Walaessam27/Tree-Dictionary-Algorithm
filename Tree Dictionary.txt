Tree Dictionary:

This data structure is a Tree where each node represents a character. Each path in the tree starting from the root and ending in one of the leaves represents a certain string. The leaves contain a special character ‘$’ which indicates the end of the string. The following figure is an example of this data structure.

Your task is to build this data structure by implementing the following operations: Insert (char *s). This operation inserts the string s in the tree.

Delete (char *s). This operation deletes the string s from the tree.
Search (char *s). This operation prints Yes or No based on whether the string s exists in the tree or not.
StartsWith(char *s). This operation prints all strings that start with string s. Strings are sorted then printed.
Longest(). This operation prints the longest string stored in the tree (assume there is only one such string).
